        Some of the code here is borrowed from the PyTorch source code.
        
        This is just a wrapper around PyTorch's own ResNet. We use it so we can only compute
        gradents over the last few layers and speed things up. Otherwise, ResNet will
        compute the usual gradients all the way through the network. 
        
        It is declared the usual way, but returns a saliency map in addition to the logits. 
        
        See: torchvision/models/resnet.py in the torchvision package. 
        
        Parameters:
        
            block:         This is the ResNet block pattern in a list. Something like [3, 4, 23, 3]
            layers:        What kind of blocks are we using. For instance models.resnet.Bottleneck . This should be callable. 
            num_classes:   How many classes will this network use? Should be an integer. Default: 1000  
            
        Will Return:
        
            logit:         The standard ResNet logits.
            saliency_map:  This is the combined, normalized saliency map which will resized to be the same
                           as the input [batch size x height x width].
